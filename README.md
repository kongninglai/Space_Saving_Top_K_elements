# Space_Saving_Top_K_elements
Implement a data mining algorithm in C which approximately finds the top-K heavy hitters (or frequent items) after making a single pass over a data stream.

## Logs
2024/04/04: 
- Finish file reading and tokenization. Next step is hash the tokenized word.
- Finish hash function. Next we can begin to implement the algorithm.

2024/04/05:
- Finish algorithm. Simple test passed. Next step is to create test database
- and implement the argument parser.
