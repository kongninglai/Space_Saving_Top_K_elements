A Line-storm Song -- Robert Frost
The line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift, 
  The road is forlorn all day, 
Where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift, 
  And the hoof-prints vanish away. 
The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,
  Expend their bloom in vain. 
Come over the hills and far with me, 
  And be my love in the rain. 

The birds have less to say for themselves 
  In the wood-worlds torn despair
Than now these numberless years the elves, 
  Although they are no less there: 
All song of the woods is crushed like some 
  Wild, easily shattered rose. 
Come, be my love in the wet woods; come,
  Where the boughs rain when it blows. 

There is the gale to urge behind 
  And bruit our singing down, 
And the shallow waters aflutter with wind 
  From which to gather your gown.    
What matter if we go clear to the west, 
  And come not through dry-shod? 
For wilding brooch shall wet your breast 
  The rain-fresh goldenrod. 

Oh, never this whelming east wind swells   
  But it seems like the seas return 
To the ancient lands where it left the shells 
  Before the age of the fern; 
And it seems like the time when after doubt 
  Our love came back amain.      
Oh, come forth into the storm and rout 
  And be my love in the rain.

The Weary Blues -- Langston Hughes
Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,
Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,
     I heard a Negro play.
Down on Lenox Avenue the other night
By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light
     He did a lazy sway . . .
     He did a lazy sway . . .
To the tune o those Weary Blues.
With his ebony hands on each ivory key
He made that poor piano moan with melody.
     O Blues!
Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool
He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.
     Sweet Blues!
Coming from a black mans soul.
     O Blues!
In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone
I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan
     "Aint got nobody in all this world,
       Aint got nobody but ma self.
       Is gwine to quit ma frownin
       And put ma troubles on the shelf."

Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor.
He played a few chords then he sang some more
     "I got the Weary Blues
       And I cant be satisfied.
       Got the Weary Blues
       And cant be satisfied
       I aint happy no mo
       And I wish that I had died."
And far into the night he crooned that tune.
The stars went out and so did the moon.
The singer stopped playing and went to bed
While the Weary Blues echoed through his head.
He slept like a rock or a man that's dead.

Morning in the Burned House -- Margaret Atwood
In the burned house I am eating breakfast.
You understand: there is no house, there is no breakfast,
yet here I am.

The spoon which was melted scrapes against
the bowl which was melted also.
No one else is around.

Where have they gone to, brother and sister,
mother and father? Off along the shore,
perhaps. Their clothes are still on the hangers,

their dishes piled beside the sink,
which is beside the woodstove
with its grate and sooty kettle,

every detail clear,
tin cup and rippled mirror.
The day is bright and songless,

the lake is blue, the forest watchful.
In the east a bank of cloud
rises up silently like dark bread.

I can see the swirls in the oilcloth,
I can see the flaws in the glass,
those flares where the sun hits them.

I can't see my own arms and legs
or know if this is a trap or blessing,
finding myself back here, where everything

in this house has long been over,
kettle and mirror, spoon and bowl,
including my own body,

including the body I had then,
including the body I have now
as I sit at this morning table, alone and happy,

bare child's feet on the scorched floorboards
(I can almost see)
in my burning clothes, the thin green shorts

and grubby yellow T-shirt
holding my cindery, non-existent,
radiant flesh. Incandescent.

On Living -- Nazim Hikmet

Living is no laughing matter:
	you must live with great seriousness
		like a squirrel, for example
   I mean without looking for something beyond and above living,
		I mean living must be your whole occupation.
Living is no laughing matter:
	you must take it seriously,
	so much so and to such a degree
   that, for example, your hands tied behind your back,
                                            your back to the wall,
   or else in a laboratory
	in your white coat and safety glasses,
	you can die for people
   even for people whose faces youve never seen,
   even though you know living
	is the most real, the most beautiful thing.
I mean, you must take living so seriously
   that even at seventy, for example, youll plant olive trees
   and not for your children, either,
   but because although you fear death you dont believe it,
   because living, I mean, weighs heavier.

Lets say were seriously ill, need surgery
which is to say we might not get up
			from the white table.
Even though its impossible not to feel sad
			about going a little too soon,
well still laugh at the jokes being told,
well look out the window to see if its raining,
or still wait anxiously
		for the latest newscast. . . 
Lets say were at the front
	for something worth fighting for, say.
There, in the first offensive, on that very day,
	we might fall on our face, dead.
Well know this with a curious anger,
        but well still worry ourselves to death
        about the outcome of the war, which could last years.
Lets say were in prison
and close to fifty,
and we have eighteen more years, say,
                        before the iron doors will open.
Well still live with the outside,
with its people and animals, struggle and wind
                                I  mean with the outside beyond the walls.
I mean, however and wherever we are,
        we must live as if we will never die.

This earth will grow cold,
a star among stars
               and one of the smallest,
a gilded mote on blue velvet
	  I mean this, our great earth.
This earth will grow cold one day,
not like a block of ice
or a dead cloud even 
but like an empty walnut it will roll along
	  in pitch-black space . . . 
You must grieve for this right now
you have to feel this sorrow now
for the world must be loved this much
                               if youre going to say I lived. . .
