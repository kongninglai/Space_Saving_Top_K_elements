Pro Swine Flu
II have been on the road for the last five months. 
I dont know, man. Im just really thinking the worst of people. 
I really am. You should see some of the animalssome of the animals I see. 
Like, I was in the airport the other day, right? Im sitting there waiting 
for my flight to take my life and watching thiswatching this lady. 
Shes eating egg McMuffins, like, plural, and just threw, like, 
three of them right down her throat like a pelican. Just, like, right 
down her gullet. And when she was done, she wiped her face with the bag. 
Ahh, with the bag, not even like a gentleman. Like, oh, Ill just do the corners, 
and, ahhhh. Then she just kind of straight-razor shaved. Just an absolute animal.
